    <h1>Suri-Da</h1>
    <h2>Professional Artist,Story Writer and a HUGE fan of ponies</h2>
    <h3>About me</h3>

    <p>My name is Suri-Da, though my close friends call me Zack. I've been studying art and story structure consistently for four years. But I am not perfect and am always looking for ways to improve my art and learn more.</p>
    <p>My setup consists of my laptop and a Gaomon M106K Pro drawing tablet. I use a sketchbook to sketch out my ideas before transfering them into my laptop, though sometimes I draw on my laptop directly. In addition, I  make use of two art programs; Sai for the lineart and shading phase, and Ibispaint X for the colour adjustments, blurs and effects. (I can also draw on my phone with a finger if anyone likes :3)</p>
    <p>My eventual plan is to move out and work in the art industry. While I currently am studying computer science at ta university level, it is more because I don't have the resources to pursue my desired future. However, that will not stop me from continuing to fight, and if God wills, maybe someday Ill get the chance.
